The answer to this question simply depends on the program language in the discussion. Some program languages like C/C++ are built to directly use multiple cores/vCPUs of the host machine for parallelism, while other languages like Golang can still utilize multiple cores but with concurrency, not parallel. Both of these types of languages can do both concurrency and parallelism very smoothly. But we have a special child like Python, whose creators put so many restrictions (which are thoughtful at creation) to be a better resource utiliser. GIL in Python makes the Python interpreter run only one thread at a time and cannot multiplex the multiple threads to multiple cores. I have already discussed this in my previous post about \",mdx(\"a\",t({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"https://santhalakshminarayana.github.io/blog/super-fast-python-why-python-slow\"}),\"Why Python is Slow\"),\".\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"To utilize multiple cores, we have to create at least one process per core. The creation and memory management of the process is time-consuming and comes with its overheads. So, a general rule of thumb is to use multi-programming for CPU-intensive tasks, and I/O bound tasks like network calls, and reading from disk are handled concurrently with threads. As we can use multi-threading in Python, creating and managing a huge number of threads is not optimal in Python or any high-level language. The solution to create and manage huge numbers of thread-like objects say in thousands or 100s of thousands, we can use Co-routines which can be termed as virtual threads or small threads whose memory footprint is very minimal compared to threads. And we can spawn thousands of these in a few microseconds.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Coroutines are part of core Python and are handled with an in-built package called \",mdx(\"a\",t({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\"}),\"asyncio\")),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The goal of this article is to demonstrate some concurrency patterns rather than learning about coroutines.
