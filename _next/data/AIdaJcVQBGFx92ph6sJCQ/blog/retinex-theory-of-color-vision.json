And Rods are a type of photoreceptor cells that are activated only when there is a low level of illumination threshold(dark light) on the scene below where cones cannot stimulate the cells and rods sense object colors as shades of gray(black and white ranges). As an image is a combination of three colors and if we can separate these three colors and make image color (red, blue, green) channels, and if viewed each channel image, it looks like a black and white image.

The color of an object in night vision is not determined by the amount of light energy we are getting at the eye, but the nature of objects which have the amount of composition of the above colors. So whether increased or decreased illumination on the scene or radiant energy coming to the eye, the color perception is close to the object's true nature in the range of white-to-black colors. Lighter objects look light and darker objects look dark irrespective of radiation flux reaching the eye. Thus we can say colors of scene/image when only one photoreceptor (here rods) is functioning are the only range of white-to-black colors. And the lightness of a point in a scene is simply how much lighter it is compared to the lightest point in the scene. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"So, the lightness value of an image/scene tells the black and white range value when only one photoreceptor is activated. You can imagine lightness as a single image channel that consists of only black and white colors as described in the above section. And this behavior can be extended to cones cells and each L, M, and S cone produce lightness values independently. The lightness of an area would be affected by the surrounding area's lightness like a small area when surrounded by a large area, the small area lightness depends on the large area if it is lighter or darker.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In our visual system, irrespective of illumination and flux reaching the eye, when light falls on the retina and it is observed by L, M, and S visual pigments independently and produce a response to the receptor system that converts these responses to produce lightness of that particular cell sensation which doesn't to relate the amount of flux energy reaching the eye.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Now one can assume this lightness as red, blue, and green sensitivity values of a scene that processed independently by three visual receptor cells.

This experiment is similar to projecting a red channel image through a red filter and a green channel image through no filter (white light). Rods cells activated when the scene was illuminated with a 550nm narrow waveband of light and long-wave receptor cells (L) activated with a 656nm narrow band of light.

From the above two-receptor experiment which produced color even though medium and short receptors haven't observed anything, Land concluded that independent lightness of each photoreceptor cell are compared to each other and the color is formed by comparing lightness values of different regions of the scene which contradicts the then existing belief of color formation by mixing of response by photoreceptors.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"For color constancy, Land stated that as the lightness of three independent receptors is independent of flux reaching the eye (and also illumination), no matter what the illumination projected on the scene out visual system produces lightness for each of three wavebands and comparison of these lightness values makes color. So we achieve color constancy because of lightness produced independently of flux. The previous statement is quite convincing to answer the human color constancy behavior. But how one can measure lightness? how to prove color constancy with lightness independent of flux? We will cover these questions in the following experiment involving the color Mondrian.\"),mdx(\"h3\",null,\"Retinex system respone\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Before proceeding to the color Mondrian experiment, let's first discuss Retinex responses that are equal to the human visual response that converts light energy to lightness for three independent receptor cells.
