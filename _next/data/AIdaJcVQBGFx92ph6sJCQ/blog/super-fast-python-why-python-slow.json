Developers prefer Python because of its easy-to-learn, flexibility, fast development, easy-to-code, readability, and many other development choices. From nowhere in the 2000s to the most used programming language right now, Python has come a long way with help of a strong community. But, there has been always a discussion on Python's choice for computation-intensive tasks like Machine Learning as Python is generally slow compared to widely used languages like C/C++ and Java. Even with the development of computation-efficient libraries and packages like Numpy, still Python is slow for general usage. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Python's core development team has been working to make Python as fast as C/C++.

Executing the code written is done by the \",mdx(\"a\",n({parentName:\"p\"},{href:\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation\"}),\"programming language implementation\"),\". This can be of two categories - Compilation and Interpretation. \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"CPython\"),\" is a Python implementation written in \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"C\"),\" that applies an interpretation approach to execute the python code written. CPython is the default runtime and reference implementation of Python and there are other runtimes like PyPy, Cython, Jython, etc., that take different execution approaches for different use cases. CPython is both an interpreter (widely represented) and a compiler as it complies the Python code to Python bytecode and then interprets it for the specific platform using Python Virtual Machine (PVM).\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"CPython uses Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) on each CPython interpreter process. This means, within a single process, only a single thread processes the Python bytecode. We will see later why this behavior is both good and bad.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"As interpretation is usually slow compared to compilation it is understood that Python is slow, but maybe up to 2x-3x times slower than C/C++. But it is not true, Java, which also interprets the code, is still many times faster than Python and this asks questions on what are other factors for slowness in Python. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Changing the runtime of Python from interpretation to compilation like Cython and embedded C-code, or JIT with PyPy, we can improve the speed of Python many times.

But with dynamic typing, there is an additional burden on the interpreter to keep track of the type of variables that makes less scope for optimization. As Java is statically typed, the interpreter can optimize the bytecode generation and can interpret it faster than Python. \"),mdx(\"pre\",null,mdx(\"code\",n({parentName:\"pre\"},{className:\"language-python\"}),`a = 1 # a as int\nb = a * 2 # b as int \n\na = 'python ' # a as string\n# c as a string with operations\n# of string and int\nc = a * b \n`)),mdx(\"p\",null,\"In the above snippet, the interpreter has to keep track of the \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"type\"),\" of \",mdx(\"strong\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"a\"),\" from top to bottom.

Even functions too. If one can remember how objects are referenced in C++ (yes, the pointers), apply the same concept in Python for everything including built-in primitive (not exactly) types which are objects too and are specially taken care of. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Assigning memory to the objects is done by creating actual memory to hold an object and a reference is given to the variables that point to the real object in the memory. Every time the variable changes its value, instead of changing the value in the memory, a new object is created and the variable is given the new location of the object that holds the new value.

This continuous cycle of object creation and deletion whenever variable values changes make runtime slow.\"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"The major overhead that needs to address is Python's way of handling collections like Lists. In \",mdx(\"em\",{parentName:\"p\"},\"C\"),\", we create the arrays with fixed memory and the address of that array is fixed, and continuous memory allocation happens for all the elements starting from the fixed memory point.

One has to manually de-allocate/free the memory. Unlike C, Python does garbage collection by using a mechanism called reference count. For every PyObject, Python keeps track of a count of how many references are pointing to the current object. If no reference is pointing to the current object, then, Python frees the memory by deleting the unused object. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"Earlier we talked about GIL that, in the current process, GIL locks the process to have only a single thread to run the Python interpreter. This does not mean we cannot use more threads, but it is hard and takes more time compared to multi-threading in other languages because CPython creates a separate environment for each thread. This limits multi-threading in Python to use only in situations where threads wait for external processes to complete like I/O operations, network requests, etc. \"),mdx(\"p\",null,\"When multiple threads access the same resource, it is hard to keep track of the reference count of objects.
