# Linux Commands Reference

This is a comprehensive list of linux commands that are most useful for developers in terms of system configuration, management, monitoring, and etc. We are not going to discuss about common commands that most people know about. Commands are categorized based on thier usage type like Networking, Memory, Text processing, and etc.

---

### Input

- **read <variable\>** or **readarray <array\>**: to read input into a single variable or an array

- **xargs**: pass standard output/input as a list of command variables for another command
  - *ls | xargs -n 3 echo*: pass up to 3 names to echo
  - *find . -type f -name '*.txt' | xargs -n 1 -P 4 -t ./sc.sh*: pass each filename as input to a bash script and also spawn 4 processes

- **|** pipe: pass standard output from another command as standard input stream to another
  - *ls -l | wc*: pass the output of *ls -l* to *wc* as an input stream

- **<**: pass stddin to a command from a file
  - *grep <pattern\> < input.txt*
