## Problems with GIL

In the previous post on [why python is slow?](https://santhalakshminarayana.github.io/blog/super-fast-python-why-python-slow), we discussed that the problems with [Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python](https://santhalakshminarayana.github.io/blog/super-fast-python-why-python-slow#gil-good-and-bad). [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil/) is part of Python's design that ensures thread-safe in Python. But, GIL only allows the interpreter to run with only one thread which makes multi-threading hard and slow in Python.

This makes multi-threading confined to use in cases like where [system releases the GIL](https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-13-the-gil-and-its-effects-on-python-multithreading/) for tasks where it waits for external processes to complete and return result/status like I/O operations, network requests, etc. To achieve better concurrency in Python, use [coroutines with asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html).

So, even if the system has multiple cores and supports 1000s of threads, multi-threading is not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. But, how to do [parallel computing](https://hpc.llnl.gov/documentation/tutorials/introduction-parallel-computing-tutorial) in Python? The answer is Multi-programming. Multi-programming creates multiple sub-processes (maximum processes can be created = no.of cores) where each process will have its interpreter with GIL and independent memory space. In processes, GIL won't be a problem because each one will have its interpreter to run the bytecode and the CPython manages multiple sub-processes. But, there are some overheads with processes like spawning/forking a process with its own memory space is slower than creating a thread and each process is separate which makes inter-process communication slow.

Also, there are external libraries like Numpy that release GIL and compute the tasks faster. [Numpy releases GIL](https://iotespresso.com/numpy-releases-gil-what-does-that-mean/) - means most of the Numpy computations are executed in C-libraries that don't require an interpreter which makes Numpy can release the GIL for that particular C-library.

[multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) module in Python offers a variety of APIs for achieving multiprocessing. In this blog, we discuss [mulitprocessing.Pool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool) class that takes multiple numbers of tasks and executes them parallelly by distributing tasks among multiple cores/workers.

> [concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor) provides a higher level interface on top of **multiprocessing** and offers additonal functions to control the process pool.

## Multiprocessing Pool

### Why and what is a pool?

Imagine we have an 8-cores CPU and create a process by allocating each process to each core for every task and executing them parallelly. If no.of tasks is <= no.of cores, then the parallel computing works smoothly. If we increase the no.of tasks to let's say 100 and create a process for each task and then execute them parallelly, the system has to manage the lifecycle of each process and ensure that processes don't hang up or reach a deadlock state. If we have numerous processes that the system can't handle we run into problems like system crash or hang.

A pool is like a strategy in parallel computing to make sure that only a certain number of workers (or cores in the CPU) are allocated to run tasks given in any number. A pool is really helpful to prevent the system from the crash while serving a very huge number of processes that may overkill the CPU if not properly managed. We create a maximum of n-workers for a system with n-cores and distribute the task to every worker to run parallelly. The main difference is that in normal execution, for every task we create a separate process, but in pool processing, first, we create a pool of processes, then distribute the tasks among the processes in the pool.

If we have 100 tasks and a pool with 5 processes, distribute the 100 tasks to the process pool by running a batch of 20 tasks per process.

Consider a function that takes around **1-second** to complete. And we have to call the function for 10 different input parameters.

The following example shows **fun_1()** as a function that takes a parameter **a**, sleeps for 1 second, and then returns the square of **a**.

> Why prefer [time.perf_counter()](https://peps.python.org/pep-0418/) over time.time()? time.time() is not monotonic - which means that the system can change the clock time with synchronization to the internet or other update. Where time.perf_counter() is system-wide and the reference point is unknown so only the results between consecutive calls are considered.

Now, call the function 10 times by passing the elements in the range(0..10). If we call the function without parallel processing, the total time will be around 10 seconds because every function call takes 1 second, and for 10 function calls it will be around 10 seconds.

```python
from os import getpid
from time import perf_counter, sleep
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count

# function that sleeps for 1 second
def fun_1(a):
    print('WORKER ID:', getpid())
    sleep(1)
    return a * a

# call fun_1 for elements in range(0..10)

# without multiprocessing
atime = perf_counter()
print('without multiprocessing')

res = [fun_1(i) for i in range(10)]

print(f"time taken without multiprocessing: {perf_counter()-atime}\n")

# with multiprocessing
atime = perf_counter()
print('with multiprocessing')

with Pool(processes=cpu_count()) as pool:
    res = pool.map(fun_1, range(10))

print(f"time taken with multiprocessing: {perf_counter()-atime}")
```

```markdown:output

```

In the above code, we applied parallel computing by passing tasks (calling **fun\_()**) to the multiprocessing pool.

The pool class constructor takes the following arguments and returns the pool object

- **processes**: no.of workers, default is all cores available in the system. We can check the available cores by calling _multiprocessing.cpu_count()_ (mine is 8)
- **initializer**: initializer function that will be called by every worker when it starts
- **initargs**: arguments to the initializer function above
- **maxtasksperchild**: max. no.of tasks a worker should execute before being replaced by another worker process. This behavior releases the workers that are using system resources for a very long time

We discuss **initializer** and **initargs** in the later section on sharing data between processes.

The pool object has several methods like apply, map, starmap, imap, etc, that serves different purpose for applying parallel computing. In the above snippet, we used Pool.map() function (same as normal map()) that takes a function and an iterable and calls the function by passing each element in the iterable as an argument. The function should accept only an argument. The Pool.map() is a blocking call and it distributes the tasks among the available cores by dividing the tasks into chunks.

Pool.map() takes the following arguments

- **func**: the function to be executed parallelly that takes one argument
- **iterable**: an iterable whose elements are passed as arguments to the function above
- **chunksize**: chunk size number that used to divide the tasks

> based on the nature of tasks, different **chunksize** numbers [schedules tasks differently](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53751050/multiprocessing-understanding-logic-behind-chunksize)

> In UNIX and such systems, [multiprocessing creates processes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods) using a fork, and in windows, it starts processes using spawn. There are some [additional restrictions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods) one should be aware of when the process start method is other than fork like protecting the entry point of the program by creating processes inside _if \_\_name\_\_==\_\_main\_\__ because spawn creates new python interpreter for each process.

As we have 8 cores available and 10 tasks at hand, Pool.map() distributes the tasks among the 8 workers by dividing tasks into chunks like [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and pass them to workers.

The total time taken with multiprocessing is 2 seconds which is 5x times faster than without multiprocessing (10 seconds).

> for large iterable size use Pool.imap() with chunksize for better efficiency

> for multiple parameters function, use Pool.starmap() or Pool.map() with partial functions

### Process vs Pool

Use process, when there is a small number of tasks and each task takes a large amount of time. Use a pool, when there is a large number of tasks and each task takes a small amount of time.

## Sharing data between processes

> It is strongly recommended to not share data between processes

### Share data with global variables (copy-on-write)

Processes created using multiprocessing run independently with their own memory space and they don't have access to the parent process's local data but they [inherit the global data of the parent](https://superfastpython.com/multiprocessing-inherit-global-variables-in-python/) (only when fork start method used).

Since child processes get a snapshot of the parent process's global data, we can utilize this behavior in a way such that we can make sharable data available to child processes by making the data global.

For the following example, we will share an integer value **x** and an array of integers **a** to calculate the sum of the product of each element in **a** with an element in the list of numbers from 0..n, n = 100000. And then compute the product of **x** and the whole sum.

```python
# function to be applied for each element
def sum_product(e):
    w_sum = sum([x*i for i in a])
    return w_sum * e

# pool initializer function
def pool_initializer(X, A):
    global x
    x = X
    global a
    a = A

n = 100000
X = 3
A = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

with Pool(processes=cpu_count(), initializer=pool_initializer, initargs=(X, A)) as pool:
    res = pool.map(sum_product, range(n))
```

In the above snippet, we initialized the pool with the _pool_initializer_ function, this function will be called for every worker after they start and any data globalized inside this initialization function is available to all child processes.

> Even though we don't need the initializer function here to share data as we can make data global at the top level and all child processes would get a snapshot of the global data, there are other cases where the initializer function is useful. Like reading a file and sharing data, making a database connection, etc, which might work on variable parameters that we can pass in pool **initargs**.

Sharing data by leveraging global variables and copy-on-write data is only useful for read-only data. If any child process changes the global variable value, they don't reflect in the parent process.

```python
from random import randint

def random_increment(i):
    rand_n = randint(0, i)
    a[rand_n] += 1
    print(f'child {i}: {a}')

n = 10
a = list(range(n))

with Pool(processes=cpu_count()) as pool:
    pool.map(random_increment, range(n))

print(f'parent {a}')
```

In the above program, we have initialized a global variable **a** which is a list. We applied the function _random_increment()_ for **n** tasks, and, _random_increment()_ function takes the number **i** and increments the list **a** at the index generated randomly in the range(0..i).

As **a** is global, we expect the list **a** change in the parent process too, but it is not true as each child process is created by copying a snapshot of the parent data and each child will have their own memory.

Look at the output of the above program below to check that, in the parent process, the value of **a** has not changed.

```markdown:Output
child 2: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 1: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 3: [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 8: [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 7: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 0: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 4: [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 9: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 5: [0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
parent [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

This is because, the data sharing happens here by following a mechanism called **copy-on-write** where the OS instead of copying and creating the new memory for the global data, just facilitates access to the parent processes memory as long as the child process doesn't change the data. As we have seen in the above example, when the child process tries to change the data, OS just allocates the new memory by copying the shared data and then writes the changes to it. So, the child's process data changes are not reflected in the parent's process because both memory locations are different. This mechanism is vice-versa means that, after forking, when the data in the parent's process changes, they are not reflected in the child's process.

### Share data using shared memory

To avoid the problems like above, **multiprocessing** provides a mechanism to share data. To share the data between child processes, one must use sockets or shared files. But, to share simple values or arrays, multiprocessing provides a mechanism called **shared ctypes** to share data safely between processes.

With [multiprocessing.sharedctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.sharedctypes), we can allocate the **ctypes** object from the shared memory and then the child processes can inherit them. [cytpes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#fundamental-data-types) are nothing but primitive **C** compatible data types and **ctypes** module provides a wrapper around these data types to use in Python. The shared memory here is nothing but the underlying memory buffer and we will discuss later how can utilize this fact to share large Numpy arrays.

Multiprocessing provides two types of shared ctypes, one for read-and-write values and arrays, and the other one for read-only values and arrays.

To manipulate data in child processes, use

- **multiprocessing.Value**: to share only single value variables such as numbers or strings
- **multiprocessing.Array**: to share an array of values of the same data type in **C**

To share read-only data, use

- **multiprocessing.RawValue**: to share only single value variables
- **multiprocessing.RawArray**: to share array of values

The main difference between raw type and normal type is that the latter provides an automatic synchronization mechanism with locks to provide process-safe data sharing.

```python
from multiprocessing import Array

def random_increment(i):
    rand_n = randint(0, i)
    a[rand_n] += 1

    print(f'child {i}: {list(a)}')

def initializer_func(A):
    global a
    a = A

n = 10
A = Array('i', range(n))

with Pool(processes=cpu_count(), initializer=initializer_func, initargs=(A,)) as pool:
    pool.map(random_increment, range(n))

print(f'parent: {list(A)}')
```

In the above code, we have passed **multiprocessing.Array** instead of the normal list. **Array** is initialized with the data type ('i') and the iterable. We can also initialize the **Array** in other ways like defining the size first and assign later.

```python
A = Array('i', 10)
A = range(10)
```

With **Array**, we can now see that the global variable **A** is updated and reflected in the parent process. Also with **Array**, we can get automatic synchronization with locks that manage by multiprocessing so that the shared data is process-safe and only one process can access the data.

```markdown:Output
child 3: [2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 7: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 5: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 2: [2, 1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 0: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 1: [2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 4: [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 8: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 8, 6, 7, 8, 9]
child 9: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 8, 6, 8, 8, 9]
child 6: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]
parent: [2, 1, 3, 5, 5, 8, 6, 8, 8, 9]
```

## Share large Numpy arrays between child processes

For each task, as we pass data as arguments to the processes, the data will be pickled so that it can be sent from one process to other. If we pass large amounts of data, pickling involves a huge amount of memory and consumes more time. So, it is better to [share large data between child processes](https://research.wmz.ninja/articles/2018/03/on-sharing-large-arrays-when-using-pythons-multiprocessing.html) instead of passing the data individually.

As we have seen in the above approach that copy-on-write sharing is good for read-only and to work with data that changes inside the child process, we have to share the data using a shared array. In this section, we will discuss sharing large Numpy arrays using a shared array.

We know that shared arrays only support primitive **C** data types and mainly 1D objects. But, how to share the Numpy arrays which are multidimensional in general to the child processes as shared ctypes do not directly support Numpy arrays? We can share Numpy arrays with some work around that is explained below.

The shared ctypes objects we get are allocated from [buffer memory](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) memory. A [buffer protocol](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/05/introduction-to-the-python-buffer-protocol/) is a framework in Python designed to provide a mechanism for Python objects to share their data among objects. Any Python objects that are implemented in C-APIs can export a set of functions called the **buffer interface**. With this buffer interface, [any object can expose its data to other objects](https://towardsdatascience.com/loading-binary-data-to-numpy-pandas-9caa03eb0672) directly without the need for copying.

As shared ctypes objects are just wrappers around the C data types whose memory was allocated from buffer memory. This is the reason why the child process's changes reflect in the parent process because the shared memory passed to child processes are implemented as [memoryview](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview) objects.

Consider the following example where we first create a large Numpy array of shape (1000, 1000), and using the process pool we assign the row number to every element in that row. As shared array doesn't support multidimensional and custom data types, a common approach is to pass the Numpy array to every worker and assign the row with a row number. But, passing the large arrays between processes take huge memory and latency. So, we utilize the buffer protocol here. Since shared array objects are provided with a buffer interface, we can rely on this shared memory and make it global so that there is no need to pass Numpy arrays as arguments to each process.

```python
def assign_int(i):
    arr = np.frombuffer(np_x.get_obj(), dtype=np.int32).reshape(np_x_shape)
    arr[i, :] = i

def pool_initializer(X, X_shape):
    global np_x
    np_x = X
    global np_x_shape
    np_x_shape = X_shape

X_shape = (1000, 1000)
data = np.zeros(X_shape, dtype=np.int32)
X = Array('i', X_shape[0] * X_shape[1])
# X as a Numpy array
X_np = np.frombuffer(X.get_obj(), dtype=np.int32).reshape(X_shape)
# copy data to the shared array
np.copyto(X_np, data)

with Pool(processes=cpu_count(), initializer=pool_initializer, initargs=(X, X_shape)) as pool:
    pool.map(assign_int, range(X_shape[0]))

print(f'Numpy array X_np:\n{X_np}')
```

First, we defined the shape of the array **X_Shape**, and then created a Numpy array with zeros of shape **X_Shape**. Second, we have created a synchronized shared array and assigned it to **X**. Third, we wrapped the shared array as Numpy using **np.frombuffer**.

**np.frombuffer** takes a 1-dimensional buffer array and interprets it into a Numpy array so we can manipulate the array easily. We used _X.get_obj()_ instead **X** because **X** is a synchronized wrapper around the raw array and calling the **get_obj()** returns the raw buffer object.

> For raw arrays (RawArray), objects should be passed normally without calling get_obj().

Why use [**np.frombuffer**](https://www.educba.com/numpy-frombuffer/)? Since Numpy arrays take a large amount of memory space, we don't want to create a copy that again takes large memory. So, using **np.frombuffer** by utilizing the buffer protocol, we can get a Numpy array which is just a wrapper around the buffer memory.

In **initiargs**, we should pass the shared array instead Numpy wrapper. We also pass the shape of the Numpy array as we need to reshape the 1D shared array into a multidimensional array in the worker function _assign_int()_.

In the worker function _assign_int()_, again we interpreted the buffer as a Numpy array and assigned the row values at row number **i**.

At last, in the parent process, we can check the multiprocessing assignment of the Numpy array.

```markdown:Output
Numpy array X_np:
[[  0   0   0 ...   0   0   0]
 [  1   1   1 ...   1   1   1]
 [  2   2   2 ...   2   2   2]
 ...
 [997 997 997 ... 997 997 997]
 [998 998 998 ... 998 998 998]
 [999 999 999 ... 999 999 999]]
```
