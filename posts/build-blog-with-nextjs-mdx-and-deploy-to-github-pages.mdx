# Build Blog with Next.js & MDX and Deploy to Github Pages

In this post, we will discuss how to create and publish a blog with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), write content with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), deploy static site to Github Pages, Image optimization to reduce the page load time and SEO for better page ranking.

> Pre-requisites: Basic understanding of React and Markdown. 

Building a blog with Next.js is very easy and it is simple to understand, develop, and maintain the dynamic websites and credit goes to Next.js dynamic paging which lets the creation of dynamic URLs and routing. When I decided to start my blog then I searched and read about many frameworks like Vanilla React, Gatsby, Hugo, etc., After reading many blogs, comments, and reviews I felt Next.js would be the option I was looking for. 

Next.js offers everything need to create a blog:
- Static site export support
- Dynamic routing
- MDX (markdown with JSX) support
- Image optimization
- SEO

Now dive in to create a simple blog

## Setup Next.js and MDX
Next.js is a React framework to create SPA (single page applications) and enables both static websites and server-side rendering. Here we'll focus only on static website generation.

### Install Next.js

[Install Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#setup) by typing any of the following commands

```bash
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

_create-next-app_ installs everything needed to start with. 

The most important thing in Next.js is the **pages** directory. Every component exported from **.js**, **.jsx**, **.ts**, or **.tsx** in the pages folder is treated as a page and each page associates with a route based on its file name. In the pages folder, the **App** component from **\_app.js** serves as the initialization of pages that can be edited for custom use like global style declaration, CDN's, etc., **index.js** is the starting point for adding content.

To write content in articles we use MDX, which lets us write JSX in Markdown (**.mdx** file). Writing in markdown is as beautiful as it is like writing in a text file and can render as HTML tags. Besides easy export and maintenance of articles, we can also reuse these files in another framework/platform which supports MDX without rewriting.

### Install MDX

Install necessary plugins for MDX

```bash
yarn add @next/mdx gray-matter next-mdx-remote
```

We installed _@next/mdx_ to handle **.mdx** files in pages directory, _gray-matter_ is to parse content from markdown and _next-mdx-remote_ for rendering markdown as HTML.

Now create / open **next.config.js** (configuration file for Next.js) at the project root level and add the following to configure MDX and handle **.mdx** page extensions in the pages folder.

```js
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
})
module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
  target: 'serverless',
})
``` 
As Next.js only looks for **.js** or **.jsx** files and gives routing to these pages, the above configuration tells Next.js to treat **.md** or **.mdx** files as pages and provide routing.

As we are creating a static site, **target: 'serverless'** notifies Next.js to generate static files for us.

Open **package.json** file in the root directory and add **deploy** command to export all static files as a folder as **out** (can have a different name) at the root level. After installing plugins and adding values **package.json** might look like this

```json
{
  "name": "blog",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "export": "next export",
    "deploy": "npm run build && npm run export"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    ---
  }
}

```

Let's give some break to configuration and take a turn to add some content.

## Home Page

As said earlier **index.js** is the pivot file and also the Home page for our website. So let's edit our Home page and customize it like below.

```js:pages/index.js
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className = 'info-container'>
      <img src = 'batman.png' alt = 'Batman Logo'/>
      <p className = 'info-description'>Hi I'm Batman, the saviour of Gotham City and I like to roam in nights to bash the bad guys.</p>
      <p className = 'info-description'>But please don't call me as a source for <b>Corona Virus</b> and it could be the <b>Joker</b> who 
      might have started this mess.</p>

      <style jsx>{`
        .info-container {
          margin: 0 5% 0 5%;
        }

        img {
          width: 20%;
          max-width: 20%;
          height: auto;
          margin-left: 40%;
        }

        .info-description {
          font-size: 20px;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the above snippet, **CSS** styles are provided inside the component. This is called **CSS-In-JS**, which is possible as Next.js bundles **styled-jsx**. There are many ways to add [CSS in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support).

In the **img** tag above, **src** is provided with the name of the image only but not relative/absolute path. In Next.js we don't need to provide complete paths if we place any assets (like images, videos) in the **public** folder. Next.js automatically prepends the path at build time for assets in the public folder.

Now to see changes, start localhost (default port is 3000) as a dev server
```bash
# starts localhost at port 8000
yarn dev -p 8000
```

Open any desktop browser and type URL http://localhost:port/ to see changes.
For the above code, the display is like below

![First preview](blog-nextjs-mdx/nextjs-blog-display.jpg)

We have a home page with a welcome message. Now some create blog posts with MDX.

## Write Blog Content with MDX

Create a directory to store our markdown posts at the root level or any accessible place. 

```shell
mkdir posts
```

Write some content in a markdown file and save it as '.mdx' inside the **posts** directory. I have created two posts and saved them as **batman-vs-superman.mdx** and **justice-league.mdx**.

```markdown:posts/batman-vs-superman.mdx
---
title: "Batman VS Superman"
description: "An intense fight between two superheroes, me and Superman."
date: "Mar 25, 2016"
---

# Batman VS Superman

I and Superman accidentally met (fight) and later realized there was a culprit (Lex Luthor) who we should fight.

As usual, it cost a whopping $250 million for this high-action story.
```

```markdown:posts/justice-league.mdx
---
title: "Justice League"
description: "Grand union with fellow superheroes which costs $300 million but received face slap from the audience."
date: "Nov 17, 2017"
---

# Justice League

Superheroes from the DC universe consisting of Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg and I met in 2017 to spoil the party plans of Steppenwolf who tried to steal Mother Boxes on Earth.

It's a very long story of how we met each other and all thanks to Avengers who had inspired me to search for other superheroes.
```

In the above snippet content inside **---** is used as metadata to make routing for this **.mdx** file. We'll discuss this later.

## Show blog posts on the Home page

### Fetch posts data

To show our blog posts on the Home page, we have to fetch the **.mdx** files and parse content. We can also provide routing from the home page to any blog post. We write the logic to fetch the **.mdx** files to read the content inside and extract metadata useful to display posts on the Home page. These files should be separated from routing, so at the root level create a folder called **lib** where we store all program files to extract **.mdx** content. Inside **lib** create a file with name **getPostsData.js** which returns posts data like markdown content, title, path, etc.,

```js:lib/getPostsData.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const matter = require("gray-matter");

// current 'posts' directory
const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts');
const mdx_file_extention = '.mdx';

function getAllFilesInDirectory() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
  return fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    return path.parse(fileName)
  })
}

function getMdxFiles() {
  const allFiles = getAllFilesInDirectory();
  return allFiles.filter(parsedFile => parsedFile.ext == mdx_file_extention);
}

export function getAllPostsPath() {
  const allMdxFiles = getMdxFiles();
  return allMdxFiles.map((parsedFile) => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: parsedFile.name
      }
    }
  })
}

export function getPostsMetaData() {
  const allMdxFiles = getMdxFiles();

  const postsMetaData = allMdxFiles.map((parsedFile) => {
    const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, parsedFile.base);

    // get MDX metadata and content
    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
    // get metadata, content
    const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);
    let metadata = data;
    metadata['id'] = parsedFile.name;
    return metadata;
  });
  return postsMetaData;
}

export function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, id + mdx_file_extention);

  // get MDX metadata and content
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');
  // get metadata, content
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents);

  let metadata = data;
  metadata['id'] = id;

  return {'metadata': metadata, 'content': content};
}
```

**getAllPostsPath** function returns all **.mdx** files path names to serve as URLs for dynamic routing of a page.

**getPostsMetaData** function returns all **.mdx** files metadata (data inside **---**) which we use to gather information like title, description, etc., and function **getPostsData** returns both metadata and markdown content to render for a particular file we request through argument **id**. **gray-matter** parses the markdown file into metadata (data inside **---**) and markdown content to render.

If encountered error while accessing **fs** add the following to _next.config.js_

```js:next.config.js
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
})

module.exports = withMDX({
	webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
		if (!isServer) {
	  	config.node = {
	    fs: 'empty'
	 		}
		}
	return config
	},
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
  target: 'serverless',
})
```
### Provide posts data to Home page

We have to call the **getallPostsData** function to get data. But how can we pass this data to the component in **pages/index.js**? Don't worry we can pass data as **props** to the component before rendering using the [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) function. **getStaticProps** allows us to fetch any dynamic data to provide before rendering the component. Change **pages/index.js** as 

```js:pages/index.js
import { getPostsMetaData } from '../lib/getPostsData.js';

export default function Home({ postsData }) {
  return (
    <div className = 'info-container'>
      <img src = 'batman.png' alt = 'Batman Logo'/>
      <p className = 'info-description'>Hi I'm Batman, the saviour of Gotham City and I like to roam in nights to bash the bad guys.</p>
      <p className = 'info-description'>But please don't call me as a source for <b>Corona Virus</b> and it could be the <b>Joker</b> who 
      might have started this mess.</p>
      <hr/>
      {postsData.map((metadata) => {
        return (
          <div key = {metadata.id}>
            <h2 className = 'post-title'>{metadata.title}</h2>
            <p className = 'post-description'>{metadata.description}</p>
          </div>
          )
        })}

      <style jsx>{`
        .info-container {
          margin: 0 5% 0 5%;
        }

        img {
          width: 20%;
          max-width: 20%;
          height: auto;
          margin-left: 40%;
        }

        .info-description {
          font-size: 20px;
        }

        .post-title {
          font-size: 24px;
          color: black;
        }

        .post-description {
          font-size: 16px;
          color: #000000e6;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const postsData = getPostsMetaData();
  return {
    props: {
      postsData: postsData,
    }
  }
}
```

Which displays as

## Rendering MDX and providing dynamic routing

So far so good until we want to display **.mdx** files as individual webpages. Right now it is not possible because Next.js only treats components exported inside the **pages** folder as webpages and provides routing, to provide routing for our posts we must export content from the **posts** directory to the **pages** folder. This is where we should spend some time to serve markdown files as webpages. 

The beauty of Next.js is that we can dynamically serve pages by fetching these **.mdx** files and provide routing inside the **pages** directory with having dynamic pages.

Create **blog** folder inside the **pages** folder and inside this **blog** folder create a file with name **[id].js**. Dynamic routes in Next.js are identified by **[]** (square brackets) in the filename. We can provide any query parameter to this **[]** page component which will end up as *http://localhost:8000/blog/post-name* for **post-name.js**. Now add following code to *pages/blog/**[id]**.js*

```js:pages/blog/[id].js
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';
import { getAllPostsPath, getPostData } from '../../lib/getPostsData.js';

const components = {
	h1: props => <h1 style = {{ 
		fontSize: 'calc(1rem + 1.5vw)', 
		color: 'black',
		margin: '1vh 0 1vh 0', }} 
		{...props} />,

	p: props => <p style = {{ 
		fontSize: 'calc(1rem + 0.1vw)', 
		color: '#000000e6',
		margin: '0vh 0 1vh 0' }} 
		{...props} />,
}

export default function Blog({ postMetadata, postContent }) {

	return (
		<div>
			<div className = 'blog-content'>
				<MDXRemote {...postContent} components = {components} /> 
			</div>

			<style jsx>{`
				.blog-content {
					display: flex;
					flex: 100%;
					flex-direction: column;
					margin: 1vw 25vw 1vw 25vw;
					width: 50vw;
					max-width: 50vw;
				}
		  `}</style>
			
		</div>
	)
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
	const paths = getAllPostsPath();
	return {
		paths,
		fallback: false,
	}
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
	const postData = await getPostData(params.id);
	const mdxSource = await serialize(postData.content);
	return {
		props: {
			postMetadata: postData.metadata,
			postContent: mdxSource,
			id: params.id,
		}
	}
}
```

If any page provides dynamic routing we must provide all dynamic paths we want to serve to this page through the [getStaticPaths](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) function.

With **serialize** and **MDXRemote**, we parse markdown content to HTML string and render it as plain HTML. To style the HTML tags in markdown, we pass custom tags as components to the MDX loader which maps tags automatically. In the above file two tags, **h1** and **p** are customized and combined as components.

Now, in the browser, hit URL *http://localhost:3000/blog/batman-vs-superman* or *http://localhost:3000/blog/justice-league* to see the post. You might see output similar to below

![MDX Post Display](blog-nextjs-mdx/mdx-post-display.jpg)

## Navigation from the Home page

What if we want to navigate from the Home page to blog posts by clicking on the title of the post? For this Next.js provides a [next/link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) component that takes care of dynamic routing from any page to another by pre-pending the necessary path before the page to navigate like navigation to **batman-vs-superman** results as *http://localhost:3000/blog/batman-vs-superman*. We must navigate like this only if we are not pre-pending the base URL manually inside the website. Now change **pages/index.js** to get dynamic navigation

```js
import Link from 'next/link';
{ ... }

{postsData.map((metadata) => {
  return (
    <div key = {metadata.id}>
      <Link href={`/blog/${metadata.id}`} key = {metadata.title} >
        <a className = 'post-title'>{metadata.title}</a>
      </Link>
      <p className = 'post-description'>{metadata.description}</p>
    </div>
    )
  })}

 { ... }
```

## Image Optimization

Images take a lot of space in a webpage which reduces page loading time results in poor performance if the user has a poor internet connection. Images can be optimized many ways like converting all PNG/JPEG files to Webp/JPEG2000 format, [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) for different screen dimensions by rescaling images, lazy loading, etc.,

Next.js provides [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) API for image optimization. But it needs the **next start** that runs on the node server which is not possible for static site generation. So we will use another plugin [next-optimized-images](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-optimized-images) which provides many options to optimize images.

Here we will optimize images to serve in Webp format, to do so install **next-optimized-images**

```shell
npm install next-optimized-images
```

Besides this install some additional plugins to convert PNG/JPEG to Webp format and loading Webp images.

```shell
npm install imagemin-mozjpeg imagemin-optipng webp-loader
```

and change _next.config.js_ as

```js:next.config.js
const withNextOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
})

module.exports = withNextOptimizedImages(
	withMDX({
		webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
				if (!isServer) {
		  		config.node = {
		    	fs: 'empty'
		 		}
			}
			return config
		},
	  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
	  target: 'serverless',
	})
)
```

In build time **next-optimized-images** exports optimized images to **images** (custom name) folder inside _out/_next/static_. So create **images** directory at the root level and move images to this folder which needs optimization and provide relative paths now which were previously not required because of the **public** folder.

Change the **img** tag in **pages/index.js** to

```jsx
<picture>
  <source srcSet={require('../images/batman.png?webp')} type="image/webp" />
  <source srcSet={require('../images/batman.png')} type="image/png" />
  <img src={require('../images/batman.png')} alt = 'Batman Logo' />
</picture>
```

This will convert a PNG image to Webp format and loads Webp images. If the browser doesn't support Webp images **<picture\>** will automatically load the normal PNG image.

You can more than this by exploring more about this plugin.

## SEO in Next.js

For Single Application Websites (SPA) SEO is a major problem which Next.js takes care of this by providing API [next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) which behaves exactly like **<head\>** in HTML. We can wrap meta properties, title, description, Open Graph (OG) properties, Twitter cards, etc., inside the **Head** component. For our Home page we can set title and description as 

![Seo in Next.js:=:80](blog-nextjs-mdx/seo-in-nextjs.jpg)

If you don't want to set meta properties, title, description, and others there are so many plugins like [next-seo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-seo) available which handle all of these manual adding for you.

## Deploy to Github pages

### Export static files to deploy

Now our website is ready to move from development to production. To host our site we can use the static-site-generator of Next.js to generate all pre-render pages bundled inside the **out** directory. Build and generate **out** directory by typing the below command in the terminal

```shell
yarn deploy
```

You can find a new directory **out** at the root level which contains all dynamic pages pre-rendered and ready to serve as HTML pages on the client-side. We will use this folder to host our website on Github pages.

### Set up Github Pages

Github Pages is a very great place to host static sites. But we need to push and configure deployment changes every time we add content to the website. This is where we utilize Github Actions which automates deployment actions according to the configuration file we provide. But first, create a repository in Github to store our code files and push source code to this repository on the **main** branch. We use the **gh-pages** branch to which Github Actions deploy static files for hosting. 

To do this we must provide access for Github Actions to this repository to access source files. To provide access, go to [Github Settings -> tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a new **personal access token** by checking **repo** scopes and others if you need and save as **GITHUB_TOKEN** (or any other name). Copy this **access code** and in the repository, move to the **secretes** tab in the **Settings** section and create a new secrete and copy this code. Remember the name of the secrete token you created in this repo for future purposes. 

![Github Repository Secretes Token:=:80](blog-nextjs-mdx/github-repo-secretes-token.jpg)

It's time to configure GitHub Actions. Create a directory called _.github/workflows_ at the root level locally. Create a file **integrate.yml** inside _.github/workflows_ and add the following configuration

```yaml:.github/workflows/integrate.yml
name: Build and Deploy
on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.1
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}/.next/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

      - name: Install and Build
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run export
        env:
            CI: true
      - run: touch out/.nojekyll

      - name: Deploy
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.7.1
        with:
          ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          BRANCH: gh-pages 
          FOLDER: out
          CLEAN: true
```
You may have to replace **ACCESS_TOKEN** with your custom name. This is what we configured

1. Execute workflow action on every push to the **master** branch.
2. Run commands *npm install && npm run build && npm run export* to build and export static version of our website.
3. Deploy contents inside **out** folder to the **gh-pages** branch.
4. Added *touch out/.nojekyll* to **gh-pages** because Github pages **Jekyll** to render static sites. **Jekyll** ignores files in the directory starting with **_** and it is an issue for us because all our static assets are created in **\_next** folder. **.nojekyll** tells Github Pages not to run published files through **Jekyll**.

Push all changes to Github repo

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "initial deployment of the blog"
git push -u origin master
```

This will push all your working source files to the Github repo and Github Actions starts a workflow to deploy static files in the **out** folder to **gh-pages**.

You can monitor the status of the Github Actions workflow after every push to the **master** branch in the **Actions** tab.

Enable Github Pages in the **Settings** section of the repo and for source select the **gh-pages** branch.

If everything worked properly you can have your website hosted at *https://<username\>.github.io/<repo\>*. Here **<repo\>** name is **blog**. 

---

## Manage CSS, assets, and page links to work properly

If you host the website at *https://<username\>.github.io/<repo\>* you can observe CSS or other static assets and routing not working properly. This is because Next.js assumes **out** directory hosted at root level as *https://<username\>.github.io/* and directs all routing, replaces assets and everything to this basepath. But we have hosted the **out** folder in **blog/out**, so we must add **subpath** **blog** to the **basepath** to manage assets linking and routing. We can do this by changing the configuration in **next.config.js**

```js:next.config.js
const ghPages = process.env.DEPLOY_TARGET === 'gh-pages';

const withNextOptimizedImages = require('next-optimized-images');

const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
})

module.exports = withNextOptimizedImages(
	withMDX({
		webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
			if (!isServer) {
		  	config.node = {
		    fs: 'empty'
		 		}
			}
			return config
		},
	  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx'],
	  target: 'serverless',
		basePath: ghPages? '/blog/' : '',
		assetPrefix: ghPages ? '/blog/' : '',
	})

While developing it works fine everything, so we check the environment phase we are processing with **process.env** and **process.env.DEPLOY_TARGET** tells the current hosted environment. In local development, we run on the **node** server hosted on our machine so we don't need to manage any **basepath** or **subpath**. 

**basePath** specifies the base path of the application to manage linking pages. If we are on the **gh-pages**, the base path **/blog/** resolves to **username.github.io/blog/** where **/** is the home path.

**assetPrefix** specifies where to look for assets (CSS, Images, etc.,).

And here we are with our personal blog on the internet and we can take our blog to next level by adding fancy CSS, custom components, and other pages like **about**, **contact**... I hope you find this articl useful to build your own blog.
